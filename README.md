# hello-world
First repository to play around. 
I am working as a system engineer, but has not been doing any programming yet. 
I did some programming during my study, but that is a long time ago.
For now I am looking at Java and Python.
For my work I am have started as a ABAP developer a few months ago. Since that moment I have put Java and Python aside for a while.
